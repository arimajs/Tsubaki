Arima's name comes from the beautiful anime
[_Your Lie in April_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Lie_in_April) about a
young pianist, Kousei Arima, who meets a violinist while dealing of the trouble
of his mother's death. It's a heart-touching, sad, hopeful, and inspirational
story that made me tear up every time I watched.

On the surface, I named my bot Arima because it's a music bot and Arima is from
a music anime. However, there's a few more layers. First of all, I got the idea
of this bot when creating a _different_ music bot for another person. It had a
similar concept, however it was based on guessing anime OPs/EDs. I though it was
only fair if I used an anime character for my bot as well. Also, I'm a weeb, so
I'm sure that plays into it.

I made this bot for the same reason Arima plays the piano: I want to make people
smile. When brainstorming ideas, I envisioned a group of friends in a voice
channel laughing at each others' attempts to sing along to the song playing and
shout, "Oh, I know this one!"

If you've checked out Arima's [github organization](https://github.com/arimajs),
you'd notice that the repository holding the documentation code is named
"Tsubaki", and the repository holding the dashboard code (which might currently
be private) is named "Kaori".

Both of these names are characters in _Your Lie in April_, and I put a great
deal of thought behind which project to name what. I'll leave it up to you to
watch the anime and try to figure out the hidden meanings :p
