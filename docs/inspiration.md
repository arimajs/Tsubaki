Arima's name comes from the beautiful anime
[_Your Lie in April_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Lie_in_April) about a
young pianist, Kousei Arima, who meets a violinist while dealing of the trouble
of his mother's death. It's a heart-touching, sad, hopeful, and inspirational
story that made me tear up every time I watched.

On the surface, I named my bot Arima because it's a music bot and Arima is from
a music anime. However, there's a few more layers. First of all, I got the idea
of this bot when creating a _different_ music bot for another person. It had a
similar concept, however it was based on guessing anime OPs/EDs. I though it was
only fair if I used an anime character for my bot as well. Also, I'm a weeb, so
I'm sure that plays into it.

I made this bot for the same reason Arima plays the piano: I want to make people
smile. When brainstorming ideas, I envisioned a group of friends in a voice
channel laughing at each others' attempts to sing along to the song playing and
shout, "Oh, I know this one!"
