You can add collaborators to your playlist so that they can edit it too! If you
want a perfect combo between your friend's favorite songs and your favorite
songs, then this is the feature for you. Get started, simply use the
`a!collab <playlist> <member | role>...` command. You can add as many
members/roles as you want!

:::tip

You can use `a!remove-collaborators` with the same format to do the reverse.

:::tip

Collaborators will be able to use the playlist in a game, add songs, and delete
songs. They will not be able to delete the playlist, or and/remove
collaborators.
