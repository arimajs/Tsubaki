In order to reward amazing guessing skills even after a game has finished, Arima
has **leveling** and **rank** features. At the end of each game you participate
in, both of those values will increase depending on how well you played.

## Levels

Levels are calculated by XP. At the end of each game, you get XP equal to
`(songs_guessed_correctly / songs_played) * minutes_played * w` where `w` is
`1500` if you won and `1000` if you didn't. Here's a calculator you can use as
an example.

XP to Levels uses a bit more complex of an algorithm. If you have more than
`62500` xp: `25 + (xp - 62500) / 5000`. Otherwise: `floor(0.1 * sqrt(xp))`

## Rank

Rank is much more straight forward, being calculated only by the amount of games
won. Note that although not shown here, each rank comes with an emote that will
be displayed next to your name in leaderboards and other relevant listings

| Games Won |         Rank         |
| :-------: | :------------------: |
|   `0-9`   |  Beginner Musician   |
|  `10-19`  | Experienced Musician |
|  `20-29`  |   Master Musician    |
|  `30-39`  |   Divine Musician    |
|   `40+`   |  Legendary Musician  |

You can view both of these stats at `a!level` and `a!rank` respectively, and
your leaderboard position at `a!leaderboard`
