If you haven't invited Arima to your server yet, you may do so through
[this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=809547125397782528&permissions=3492928&scope=bot)

:::

Let's get started: how do you play? First, you need to find a playlist. You can
grab a playlist/album from Youtube, Soundcloud, Spotify, or
[**create your own**](/docs/custom). You can also input keywords to search on
youtube, however this method is very inconsistent and will return no results
more often than not. If you don't have a playlist in mind yet, you can use this
sample playlist on Youtube:

```
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLomnF-6GejKEfXSEvgnjJtFB4C7P0e9kj
```

## Starting a Game

:::tip

You can view all possible options to modify when starting a game by using
`a!help start`

:::

To start a game, first join a voice channel. You can play with friends or by
yourself. Once you join, choose a voice channel to play the game in. If your
guild has the quiz channel set (`a!quiz-channel`), you'll only be able to play
in that channel.

After picking the text channel, send `a!start link_here` to start a game. Arima
will join your voice channel, process the link you gave, and the send a
confirmation message that the game is starting.

## Guessing a Song

To guess a song, simply send the song title/artist name in the text channel.
Don't worry about punctuation, spelling, or any other small inconsistencies in
the text. As long as what you write is _similar_ to the correct answer, it will
be accepted. If the answer is incorrect, it will be ignored.

Once you guess correctly, Arima will move onto the next song and you'll gain a
point on the leaderboard. This process will continue until:

- Someone reaches a predefined goal set in the command options
- The playlist runs out of songs
- The bot is left alone in the voice channel
- The bot is kicked from the voice channel
- The `a!end` command is used (by the host)
- The connection encounters an error

If you don't know a song, use the `a!skip` command. This command requires the
majority of members to agree via reaction.
