## What Data Do We Store?

### Identifiers

We store user and guild IDs to link accounts with leaderboard rankings, created
playlists, and guild settings.

### Analytics

We collect basic analytics for Arima. This includes how many times each command
has been used, how many games have been played, how many errors have occurred,
how many servers Arima is in, RAM and CPU usage, and ping. No user or guild data
is tracked.

## Where is my Data Stored?

All data is stored in a secure, encrypted database that not even Arima admins
have access to. If you would like to remove any saved data, please contact me
using one of the methods listed at the top of the page.
