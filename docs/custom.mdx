First thing's first: what is a custom playlist? A custom playlist is a
collection of songs put together and managed entirely through Arima. To start,
simply use `a!create-playlist name_here`. Boom! Now you have a playlist.

:::note

You can only have **3** playlists and **100** songs per playlist. Furthermore,
all songs must be over 30 seconds, and duplicate links will not be allowed.

:::

You can get a song link the exact same way you'd
[get a playlist link](/docs/start#finding-a-playlist), but obviously with a song
instead of a playlist. Once you have a song in mind, you can use
`a!addsong playlist_name song_here`. This is explained in depth in the
[understanding commands guide](/docs/commands), but be wary that you'll have to
surround your playlist name in quotes if it is multiple words.

If you wanted to merge a playlist of songs (maybe create a collection of both
you and your friend's playlist for a more even game), you can use the same
format using `a!addsongs` instead of `a!addsong`.

:::tip

There's so much more to do! Check out `a!playlists`, `a!playlist-info`,
`a!song-info`, and more by using the `a!help` command.
